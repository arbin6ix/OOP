                Tarneeb is a card game played with 4-players. The players are split into 2 teams of two players each where players from the same team are seated opposite to each other. It requires a standard 52-card Anglo-American deck to play.

                Each player is dealt 13 cards.
                Bids are done beginning with the player to the right of the dealer. 
                The highest bidder can declare the Tarneeb (trump) suit for the round and plays first. 
                Trick-taking goes as usual as other trick card games. 
                The first team to reach a score of 31 wins the game.

                Tarneeb scoring is based on the bids of each team, and the number of take tricks.
                Each team’s score is the sum of the number of tricks taken by both team players. The team’s bid threshold is the highest bid among the team members.
                For example, if Player ‘A’ and ‘C’ are from the same team, and Player ‘A’ bids 9, whereas Player ‘C’ bids 8.
                The team therefore has a bid threshold of 9.
                If the bid is met or exceeded, the team is awarded a score equivalent to the number of tricks won.
                If the bid requirement is not met, the team has the bid number subtracted from their score.
                This means it is possible for a team to have negative scores at any given time.

                Betting starts with the player to the dealer’s right and moves counterclockwise. The lowest bid is 7 and the highest is 13, and they represent the number of tricks that the bidder’s team thinks they can take with the cards they are dealt.
                Each bid must be higher than the last, and a player who does not wish to bid at their turn can pass.
                Once you choose to pass you are out of the bidding for the current round, and the bidding continues around the table as many times as necessary until it settles on the highest bidder.
